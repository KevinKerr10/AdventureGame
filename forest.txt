You step beneath the forest canopy, and the world shiftsâ€”sunlight filters through the leaves in shifting patterns, and the air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. Birdsong mixes with the rustle of unseen creatures, and every branch seems to sway with quiet, watchful life. The deeper you go, the quieter it gets.
